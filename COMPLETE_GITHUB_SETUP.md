## 💡 Pro Tips

### Speed Up Deployments
```yaml
# Already configured in deploy.yml
- Dependency caching ✅
- Build artifact caching ✅
- Parallel jobs ✅
```

### Protect Main Branch
```
Settings → Branches → Add rule

- Prevent direct pushes
```

### Monitor Deployments
```
Actions tab → Workflow runs
- See build logs
- Check deploy status
- Debug failures
```

### Add Status Badge
```markdown
![Deploy](https://github.com/USER/REPO/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Workflow doesn't trigger
**Fix:** Check `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists

### Issue: Build fails
**Fix:** Run `npm run build` locally first

### Issue: 404 on deployed site
**Fix:** Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"

### Issue: Permission denied
